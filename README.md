Thanks for downloading the demo for SOIREE.

This project was created in Godot Engine 4.4, using GDScript as the way to code the game.
This project provides a build in rule book for the games in it, making it easier to understand each game mode.

As of now, the demo implements two games modes Higher or Lower and BlackJack.
It will receive more content in future updates.

If needed, player can change some settings regarding audio and gameplay, adjusting to each player's experience.

Once again i appreciate you for being here.
Have fun gambling!
